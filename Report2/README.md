# US Drug Use Analysis 2

This report expands upon the analysis performed in US Drug Use Analysis 1. It combines multiple data sets to get a wider view of drug behaviors over time and constructs a Drug Impact Index which is based upon the number of users present in the population, the proportion of users which utilize recovery services (ex. Drug Rehabiliation), and the proportion of users which utilize emergency services (ex. Hospital Emergency Room).
